# TreePIR: Efficient Private Retrieval of Merkle Proofs via Tree Colorings with Fast Indexing and Zero Storage Overhead

## Abstract
A Batch Private Information Retrieval (batch-PIR) scheme allows a client to retrieve multiple data items from a database without revealing them %the identities of these items to the storage server(s). Most existing approaches for batch-PIR are based on batch codes, which incur large storage overheads. In this work, we show that \textit{zero} storage overhead is achievable for tree-shaped databases. In particular, we develop \textit{TreePIR}, a novel approach tailored made for private retrieval of the set of nodes along an arbitrary \textit{root-to-leaf path} in a Merkle tree with no storage redundancy. This type of trees has been widely implemented in many real-world systems such as Amazon DynamoDB, Google's Certificate Transparency, and blockchains. Tree nodes along a root-to-leaf path forms the well-known \textit{Merkle proof}. TreePIR, which employs a novel tree coloring, outperforms the state-of-the-art Probabilistic Batch Codes (PBC) (Angel \et~IEEE S\&P'18) in all metrics, achieving $3\times$ lower total storage and communication cost and $1.5$-$2\times$ faster max/total server computation time and client query generation time. Most notably, TreePIR's \textit{polylog}-complexity indexing algorithm is $19$-$160\times$ faster than PBC for trees of $2^{10}$ - $2^{24}$ leaves.
